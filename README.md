# 🚀 NeuroForge: Adaptive Intelligence Engine
### Forging knowledge through adaptive intelligence.
#### Powered by Gemini 3 Flash & Pro AI Models

NeuroForge is a high-performance educational platform designed for the modern scholar. It transforms static learning into a dynamic, adaptive experience using cutting-edge Generative AI to synthesize curriculum-specific content on the fly.

## 🌟 Core Features

### 1. **Neural Flashcard Synthesis**
- **Descriptive Questions:** No more simple terms. The AI generates deep, descriptive questions (e.g., *"How do plants transform light into energy?"* instead of just *"Photosynthesis"*) to trigger actual conceptual recall.
- **Difficulty Calibration:** Choose between **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** levels to scale the complexity of definitions and terms.
- **Session Persistence:** Your progress is automatically saved. Exit a session and return exactly where you left off.
- **Active Recall Mode:** Test yourself with scoring. Includes a **Skip Card** feature to move past cards without penalty when needed.
- **3D Interactive Interface:** Fluid flip animations with a specialized tech-forward UI (JetBrains Mono typography).

### 2. **Adaptive AI Quizzes**
- **Topic-Specific Focus:** Target your weak areas by entering specific focus topics (e.g., *"Thermodynamics"*, *"Ancient Rome"*).
- **Learning Gaps Identification:** The engine tracks every mistake. It analyzes patterns and identifies specific learning gaps to prioritize in future sessions.
- **Live AI Feedback:** Every incorrect answer triggers an immediate "Expert Briefing"—personalized explanations from a virtual AI tutor.
- **Resumable Assessments:** Long quizzes can be paused and resumed later via encrypted local persistence.

### 3. **Scholar Analytics Dashboard**
- **Neural Growth Tracking:** Visualize your mastery over time with a dynamic progress graph.
- **Subject Average:** Compare individual performance against your overall subject mastery.
- **Global Average & Attempt Log:** Maintain a permanent record of all assessments across different subjects and grades.

### 4. **Adaptive Aesthetics**
- **Light & Dark Theme Engine:** Seamlessly toggle between a high-tech "Neural Dark" mode and a clean, high-contrast "Scholar Light" mode.
- **Intro Experience:** A brief, immersive startup sequence representing the Forge AI engine initialization.

## 🚦 Operational Procedures

1. **Initialization:** Define your academic level (Grade 1-12) and primary target subject.
2. **Review:** Launch a Neural Forge module to build a foundational conceptual base.
3. **Assessment:** Trigger a Quiz session to stress-test your knowledge. Use **Focus Topics** for targeted practice.
4. **Correction:** Study the **Expert Briefing** for any missed questions to bridge learning gaps.
5. **Certification:** Export your profile once you reach a >90% Mastery Score across your active subjects.
